## What I Like About the Site
Smashing Magazine is an interesting and interactive way to stay engaged with the tech field as a whole.
It also provides many resources for learning more about the area of development that most interests you.
Further, you can get exposure to other people in your area of interest since the site's content does not come solely from a team of writers, but people who post podcasts, present workshops, and host conferences.
